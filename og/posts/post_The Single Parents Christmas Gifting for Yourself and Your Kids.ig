Hey single parents! 👋 Let's have an honest chat about Christmas. We all love seeing our kids' faces light up, but often, the person doing ALL the gifting receives nothing for themselves. 🎁🚫

It's a powerful reminder that the emotional toll of single parenting during the holidays is real. You are a superhero, and you deserve to feel special too! ✨

This year, let's redefine "receiving." Whether it's a planned self-gift, a quiet moment of peace, or simply acknowledging your incredible efforts – make space for *your* joy. You give so much, it's okay to give to yourself.
